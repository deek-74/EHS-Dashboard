This project presents a comprehensive Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Dashboard built from scratch using Power BI. It tracks both leading and lagging indicators such as TRIR, LTIs, near misses,
PPE compliance, waste generated, safety trainings, and fire drills across multiple industrial sites and over time.

The goal is to enable data-driven decision-making for improving workplace safety, enhancing environmental performance, and supporting sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting.
